# Development CLI

## Problem
As a contractor I often work on different machines: Mac, Linx and Windows. Everytime I start on a new machine I have to use different tools to perform the same tasks. It takes effort to be across all the different tools, and to setup each new machine with those tools

## Solution
This Docker image enables me to run all my faviourite preconfigured tools on any machine, whereever I am, with minimal effort.

## Usage
* When closing shell with the exit linux command

## Development
* bin/build.sh - builds the docker image
* bin/run.sh - runs the docker image as a container

### Prerequisite
Install [Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) fonts

### MacOS
```
brew install neovim
```
